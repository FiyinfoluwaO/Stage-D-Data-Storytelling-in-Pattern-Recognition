# Stage-D-Data-Storytelling-in-Pattern-Recognition on FOOD SHORTAGE SOLUTION
Data Exploration on Africa's food production and consumption (supply), formulating and testing a hypothesis, and visualisation of results.
# DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES IN THE REPOSITORY
**"African Countries Map.pbix"** This is the Map visualization of the Remaining 38 African Countries.

**"fdd.csv"** This is a dataset of the grouped food production and containing the value of Rice Items produced in the different african countries.

**"fddr.csv"** This is the dataset of the cleaned food production (i.e. grouped and refined) with additional column (POPULATION) for ease of analysis

**"food consumption.csv"** This is the Main food consumption dataset given in the course outline. The PDF version of this dataset was converter to CSV file using a PDF to CSV online converter tool.

**"food production.csv"** This is the Main food production dataset given in the course outline. The PDF version of this dataset was converter to CSV file using a PDF to CSV online converter tool.

**"food_ConsYear.csv"** This is the food consumption dataset with the addition of kcal/person/day unit to the value of the Items consumed.

**"food_ConsYear2.csv"** This is the Refined food consumption dataset.

**"food_data stageD.csv"** This is the food production dataset with the addition of kt "kilotons" unit to the Item Value.

**"food_dataGitems.csv"** This is the grouped food production dataset after the addition of Kilotons-unit.

**"food_dataGyear.csv"** This is the food production dataset showing 3 columns: "Country", "Year", and "Value". It also contain the Totalled Value of Items produced in a year.
